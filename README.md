  This project involves creating an interactive questionnaire with animated transitions and validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form has smooth input field animations, with subtle transitions when focusing on fields. It also includes dynamic hover effects for buttons and cards, giving a modern look. Upon form submission, the answers are validated against predefined keywords, and any incorrect answers trigger shake animations. Successful form submission triggers a confetti animation, celebrating the achievement. The design is enhanced with a sleek, card-like layout for the questions, making the user experience engaging and visually appealing. This project is ideal for competitive design presentations.
